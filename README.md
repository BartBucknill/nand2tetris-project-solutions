# nand2tetris course project solutions

The nand2tetris course is project based, and students create a computer from basic logic gates up to an operating system and higher level language.
I'm taking this course on [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)
nand2tetris site: https://www.nand2tetris.org/

This repo includes:
- supplied project materials,
- my work on the project (such as HDL specs of logic gates),
- helpers/other materials (such as the bash script for running all tests for a module.)
